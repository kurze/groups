- **Production**: 
  - Option 1: Managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)
  - Option 2: Platform-as-a-Service (Fly.io, Railway)
  - Option 3: VPS with Docker Compose

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- 80%+ test coverage

### Business Metrics
- User registration rate
- Group creation rate
- Event attendance rate
- User retention (MAU/DAU)
- Member engagement scores

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database scalability**: Plan migration path to PostgreSQL
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Implement caching early
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits
- **Data loss**: Automated backups from day one

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Focus on UX and core features
- **Feature creep**: Maintain focused roadmap
- **Competition**: Differentiate with unique features
- **Compliance**: Consider GDPR/privacy requirements

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to building a full-featured group management platform. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation while delivering value incrementally. The timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused development effort.

Priority should be given to authentication and authorization as these are fundamental to all other features. Early decisions about architecture and data models will have long-lasting impacts, so careful consideration should be given to these aspects.
